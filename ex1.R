github <- oauth_endpoints("github")


# 2. Register an application at https://github.com/settings/applications;
#    Use any URL you would like for the homepage URL (http://github.com is fine)
#    and http://localhost:1410 as the callback url
#
#    Insert your client ID and secret below - if secret is omitted, it will
#    look it up in the GITHUB_CONSUMER_SECRET environmental variable.

# 3. Get OAuth credentials

# Question 2 - Which of the following commands will select only the data for the probability weights pwgtp1 with ages less than 50?
# sqldf("select * from acs where AGEP < 50")
# sqldf("select pwgtp1 from acs where AGEP < 50")

sqldf("select pwgtp1 from acs where AGEP < 50")     # YES - selects the correct column and for ages less than 50
sqldf("select pwgtp1 from acs")                     # NO - only selects pwgtp1 column
sqldf("select * from acs")                          # NO - selects everything

# Question 3 - Using the same data frame you created in the previous problem, what is the equivalent function to unique(acs$AGEP)

unique(acs$AGEP) # this is the desired result

sqldf("select unique AGEP from acs")                # NO - syntax error
sqldf("select distinct AGEP from acs")              # YES? - generates the same list but in a different format
sqldf("select distinct pwgtp1 from acs")            # NO - selects the distinct values of the wrong column
sqldf("select unique * from acs")                   # NO - syntax error

# Question 4 - How many characters are in the 10th, 20th, 30th and 1000th lines of HTML from this page
